# jfrog

JFrog Platform integration for Cursor: artifact management, security scanning, supply-chain best practices, and Agent Guard.

## Prerequisites

1. **JFrog Platform** access (Cloud or self-hosted).
2. An admin must **enable the JFrog MCP Server** on the platform (Cloud/SaaS only):
   - Navigate to **Administration > General > Settings** in the JFrog UI.
   - Toggle the **MCP Server** option ON and save.
3. Set the `JFROG_URL` environment variable to your JFrog instance URL, including the protocol and **without** a trailing slash (e.g., `https://mycompany.jfrog.io`). This matches the JFrog CLI convention for `JFROG_URL` / `JF_URL`.
4. **JFrog CLI** (`jf`) is used by the skills for authentication and REST/GraphQL API operations. Install via `brew install jfrog-cli` or the [official install script](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-cli/install-the-jfrog-cli).

Authentication is handled automatically: **OAuth** for MCP-based workflows, **`jf config`** for CLI/REST-based skills. For CLI authentication, you can also set `JFROG_ACCESS_TOKEN` or use `jf login` for browser-based login.

## Included

| Component | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **MCP** | `mcp.json` | Remote JFrog MCP server (OAuth, no API keys) |
| **Rule** | `rules/jfrog-security.mdc` | Supply-chain security practices for dependency files |
| **Agent** | `agents/supply-chain-security.md` | Dependency audit for CVEs, licenses, and curation |
| **Hook** | `hooks/hooks.json` | Agent Guard: MCP server governance via JFrog AI Catalog |

### Skills

| Skill | Triggers when you mention... |
|-------|------------------------------|
| **jfrog** | any JFrog product, artifactory, xray, security, access token, curation, distribution, release bundle, apptrust, runtime, mission control, worker, jf command, or best practice |
| **jfrog-package-safety-and-download** | package safety, curation, allowed/blocked packages, downloading packages via JFrog |

The **jfrog** skill (`skills/jfrog/`) provides platform-wide coverage via a three-tier tool selection strategy: MCP tools (preferred), JFrog CLI commands (fallback), and `jf api` REST/GraphQL (last resort). It includes 24 reference files under `references/` and 3 automation scripts under `scripts/` covering Artifactory, Security/Xray, Access, Distribution, Curation, AppTrust, Mission Control, Workers, and architectural patterns.

The **jfrog-package-safety-and-download** skill (`skills/jfrog-package-safety-and-download/`) handles package safety checks: querying the JFrog Public Catalog, interpreting security signals, checking curation policies, and downloading packages through Artifactory remote caches.

## MCP Capabilities

The JFrog MCP Server provides:

- **Resource Management** — create and manage projects and repositories
- **Artifact Search** — AQL queries to find artifacts across your organization
- **Catalog & Curation** — package info, vulnerability status, curation compliance
- **Security Monitoring** — real-time DevSecOps reports and CVE tracking
