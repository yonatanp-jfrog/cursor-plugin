# jfrog

JFrog Platform integration for Cursor — artifact management, security scanning, and supply-chain best practices.

## Prerequisites

1. **JFrog Platform** access (Cloud or self-hosted).
2. An admin must **enable the JFrog MCP Server** on the platform (Cloud/SaaS only):
   - Navigate to **Administration > General > Settings** in the JFrog UI.
   - Toggle the **MCP Server** option ON and save.
3. Set the `JFROG_PLATFORM_URL` environment variable to your JFrog instance (e.g., `mycompany.jfrog.io`).
4. **JFrog CLI** (`jf`) is used by several skills for authentication and REST API operations. It will be installed automatically if missing. Install manually via `brew install jfrog-cli` or the [official install script](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-cli/install-the-jfrog-cli).

Authentication is handled automatically — **OAuth** for MCP-based workflows, **browser-based login** (`jf config`) for CLI/REST-based skills. No manual API keys or tokens required.
